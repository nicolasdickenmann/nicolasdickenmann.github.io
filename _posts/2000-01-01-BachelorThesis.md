title: "Bachelor's Thesis - A Reinforcement Learning
Approach to Generate Network
Topologies"
date: 2000-01-07
category: project
details:
  - Developed an architecture from scratch utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate interconnect topologies of diameter-3 for data centers at the <i>Scalable Parallel Computing Lab</i> of ETH Zurich.  
     
  - "• The thesis is not published as of now, but part of my work served as foundation for <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11223'>this paper</a> (see acknowledgments)." 
  - "• Profiled, optimized and parallelized the architecture for a 10x increase in self-play games."
